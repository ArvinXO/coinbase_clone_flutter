## Compiling the app

Before anything, be sure to have a working flutter sdk setup.If not installed, go to [Install - Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

Be sure to disable signing on build.gradle or change keystore to sign the app.

For now the required flutter channel is master, so issue those two commands before starting building:

```
$ flutter channel master
```

```
$ flutter upgrade
```

After that, building is simple as this:

```
$ flutter pub get
```

```
$ flutter run
```

```
$ flutter build apk
```
